# MNIST app using Streamlit  
## Functions  
-choose between CNN and KNN classifiers (the CNN is the same model I used in my kaggle notebook https://www.kaggle.com/iamandrewliao/mnist-cnn)  
-upload your own images to test (I have written functions that resize and reshape the images to be ready for modeling)
